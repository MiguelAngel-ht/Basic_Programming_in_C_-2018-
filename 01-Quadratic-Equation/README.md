# Square Root Calculator in C

This is a simple C program that calculates the square root of a quadratic equation. It provides solutions for both positive and negative discriminants.

## Key Functions

Below are the two most relevant functions in the code:

### Main Function

```c
int main(int argc, char** args)
{
   // Definition of variables for the quadratic equation and discriminant
   // ...

   // Prompt the user for the values of a, b, and c
   // ...

   // Calculate the discriminant
   // ...

   // Check the value of the discriminant and calculate the solutions
   // ...

   // Print the solutions to the output
   // ...

   return 0;
}
```

## Steps to use
 1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
 2.Run the program and follow the instructions to input the values of a, b, and c.
 3.The program will calculate the solutions of the quadratic equation and display them in the output.
